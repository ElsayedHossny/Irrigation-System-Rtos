# Irrigation-System-Rtos 🌱💧

An automated irrigation system built using a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) scheduler.  
This project aims to manage water distribution efficiently based on time schedules or sensor data

## 📦 Features

- **Automated Scheduling:** Precisely controls irrigation times and durations.
- **Sensor Integration:** Supports soil moisture and environmental sensors for adaptive watering.
- **RTOS-Based Architecture:** Ensures real-time task management and system responsiveness.
- **Modular Design:** Facilitates easy expansion and maintenance.
- 🌿 Automatic irrigation scheduling
- ⏱️ RTOS-based task management
- 💡 Low-power and efficient
- 🧠 Modular and easy to extend
  
## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32 or any compatible MCU.
- **Sensors:** Soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor (optional) "Sensor : DHT22".
- **Actuators:** Solenoid valves or water pumps.
- **Power Supply:** Appropriate power source for the microcontroller and actuators.

## 🖥️ Software Requirements

- **Development Environment:** Atmel Studio, Microchip Studio, or PlatformIO.
- **Programming Language:** C.
- **RTOS:** Custom scheduler implemented for task management.
